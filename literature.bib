@article{ieee4517003,
	abstract = {An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is tasked to explore an unknown environment and to map the features it finds, but must do so without the use of infrastructure-based localisation systems such as GPS, or any a priori terrain data. The UAV navigates using a statistical estimation technique known as simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) which allows for the simultaneous estimation of the location of the UAV as well as the location of the features it sees. SLAM offers a unique approach to vehicle localisation with potential applications including planetary exploration, or when GPS is denied (for example under intentional GPS jamming, or applications where GPS signals cannot be reached), but more importantly can be used to augment already existing systems to improve robustness to navigation failure. One key requirement for SLAM to work is that it must reobserve features, and this has two effects: firstly, the improvement of the location estimate of the feature; and secondly, the improvement of the location estimate of the platform because of the statistical correlations that link the platform to the feature. So our UAV has two options; should it explore more unknown terrain to find new features, or should it revisit known features to improve localisation quality. These options are instantiated into the online path planner for the UAV. We present the SLAM algorithm and evaluate two important properties about the algorithm which assist in developing a path planning module for the UAV. The first of these is the use of the probabilistic measure of "entropy" as an information-based measure of the certainty in the map and vehicle locations, and is used as a utility function for planning the UAVs trajectory and determining the order in which features in the map are observed. The second is an observability analysis of SLAM which presents the unobservable states which are dependent on vehicle maneuvers. The analysis dictates the type of manoeuvres required by the UAV while- - observing features in order to maintain accurate statistical estimates of the map and vehicle location. This has the effect of reducing the action space that the path planner needs to search over. Using these two properties, we demonstrate an online path planner that intelligently plans the vehicle's trajectory while exploring unknown terrain in order to maximise the quality of both the map and vehicle location. Results of the online path planning algorithm are presented using a 6-DoF simulator of our UAV. The results show that the vehicle localisation errors are constrained and that the number of features and the size of the map steadily grows during the flight.},

	abstract = "Volltreffer, UAV wird zu Stellen mit Hohem erwarteten InformationGain geschickt: To calculate the expected information gain, we simply simulate forward in time the expected covariance of the estimate errors from our current knowledge using all of the expected observations along the path to the end destination and substitute into equation (20) Future unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications will require high-accuracy localisation in environments in which navigation infrastructure such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) and prior terrain maps may be unavailable or unreliable. In these applications, long-term operation requires the vehicle to build up a spatial map of the environment while simultaneously localising itself within the map, a task known as simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM). In the first part of this paper we present an architecture for performing inertial-sensor based SLAM on an aerial vehicle. We demonstrate an on-line path planning scheme that intelligently plans the vehicle's trajectory while exploring unknown terrain in order to maximise the quality of both the resulting SLAM map and localisation estimates necessary for the autonomous control of the UAV. Two important performance properties and their relationship to the dynamic motion and path planning systems on-board the UAV are analysed. Firstly we analyse information-based measures such as entropy. Secondly we perform an observability analysis of inertial SLAM by recasting the algorithms into an indirect error model form. Qualitative knowledge gained from the observability analysis is used to assist in the design of an information-based trajectory planner for the UAV. Results of the online path planning algorithm are presented using a high-fidelity 6-DoF simulation of a UAV during a simulated navigation and mapping task",

In the proposed approach, images of the environment are first sampled and stored as a set of ordered key images (visual path) and organized providing a visual memory of the environment. The robot navigation task is then defined as a concatenation of visual path subsets (called visual route) linking the current observed image and a target image belonging to the visual memory. The UAV is controlled to reach each image of the visual route using a vision-based control law adapted to its dynamic model and without explicitly planning any trajectory.

The vision system is centered around Geyer et al.'s recursive multi-frame planar parallax algorithm (2006), which accurately estimates 3D structure using geo-referenced images from a single camera, as well as a modular and efficient mapping and terrain analysis module. The vision system determines the best trajectory to cover large areas of terrain or to perform closer inspection of potential landing sites, and the flight control system guides the vehicle through the requested flight pattern by tracking the reference trajectory as computed by a real-time MPC-based optimization. This trajectory layer, which uses a constrained system model, provides an abstraction between the vision system and the vehicle.

	abstract = "This paper describes a receding-horizon optimal control scheme for autonomous trajectory generation and flight control of an unmanned air vehicle in urban terrain. In such environments, the mission objective or terrain may be dynamic, and the vehicle may change dynamics mid-flight due to sensor or actuator failure; thus off-line pre-planned flight trajectories axe limiting and insufficient. This technology is aimed at supporting guidance and control for future missions that will require vehicles with increased autonomy in dangerous situations and with tight maneuvering and operational capability e.g., missions in urban environments. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is described here that navigates a vehicle with nonlinear dynamics through a vector of known way-points to a goal, and manages constraints. In this MPC-based approach to trajectory planning with constraints, a feedforward nominal trajectory is used to convert the nonconvex, nonlinear optimal control problem into a time-varying linear, convex optimization or quadratic programming problem. The nonconvex, admissible path space is converted to a sequence of overlapping, convex spaces. The feedforward control that produces the nominal trajectory is found from the vehicle's differentially flat outputs. MPC is used to determine the optimal perturbations to the nominal control that will suitably navigate the vehicle through a constrained input/output space while minimizing actuation effort. Simulation results with a non-real-time, online MPC controller for a UAV in a planar urban terrain are included to support the proposed approach",

	abstract = "Early in the race to space in the 1950s, the U.S. Department of Defense found that tracking the position of satellites could be used to track fixed bodies on the surface of the Earth. No one realized that the NAVSTAR GPS satellite constellation program, that began its research and development in 1973 and launching its first four satellites in 1978, would change the very nature of our world in the next two decades. The system later to be known simply as the Global Positioning System (GPS) would not only provide complex navigation and timing capability to the military but, might very well, be the backbone to energize the faltering economy in 2001. A myriad of evolving GPS applications and complementary technologies may spawn new, much needed economic growth. Advances in integrated circuit technology and high-volume applications have helped to bring the price of GPS receivers down to $100-$500. The size of GPS receivers has now been considerably reduced. Prices and device sizes will continue to fall in the next decade while the applications for this technology will continue to blossom. It should be no surprise when this technology affects each of us, and, is used in every home and business in some form during this decade.",

We described the components and current capabilities of a small UAS developed specifically for wildlife and ecological surveys that is currently in field use for a variety of applications. We also reviewed government regulations currently affecting the use of UASs in civilian airspace. Information on capabilities and regulations will be valuable for agencies and individuals interested in the potential UASs offer for monitoring wildlife populations and their habitat. Descriptions of current uses and recommendations for future employment will be helpful in implementing this technology efficiently for aerial surveys as the civilian sector begins to adopt UASs for peacetime missions.",

This paper proposes a method for mobile robot exploration based on the idea of frontier exploration which suggests navigating the robot toward the boundaries between free and unknown areas in the map. A global occupancy grid map of the environment is constantly updated, based on which a global frontier map is calculated. Then, a histogram based approach is adopted to cluster frontier cells and score these clusters based on their distance from the robot as well as the number of frontier cells they contain. In each stage of the algorithm, a sub-goal is set for the robot to navigate. A combination of distance transform and A* search algorithms is utilized to generate a plausible path toward the sub-goal through the free space. This way keeping a reliable distance from obstacles is guaranteed while searching for the shortest path toward the sub-goal. When such a path is generated, a B-spline interpolated and smoothed trajectory is produced as the control reference for the mobile robot to follow. The whole process is iterated until no unexplored area remains in the map. The efficiency of the method is shown through simulated and real experiments.",

	abstract = {Locating sensors in 2D can be modeled as an art gallery problem, which asks to locate the minimum number of omnidirectional sensors, or "guards" to "cover" a polygonal floor map. The problem is NP-hard, and no finite algorithm, even exponential, is known for its exact solution. The approximate algorithms in the literature are polynomial in the worst case, but their performance with respect to the optimal solution is either bad or, in most cases, unknown. Recently, a new incremental sensors location algorithm that attempts to balance execution times and closeness to optimum has been presented. The algorithm converges toward the optimal solution, and uses a lower bound for the number of sensors, specific of the polygon considered, for evaluating the quality of the solution. We have implemented and extensively tested the algorithm. Closeness to optimal and computation times have been measured for a large number of randomly generated polygons with or without holes, rectilinear polygons and real building floor maps. The experimental results show that the algorithm supplies solutions very close to, and often coincident with, the lower bound and therefore nearly optimal or optimal. Running times allow dealing with polygons with many tens, or even a few hundreds of edges, which appears adequate to most practical cases.},

This problem can be modeled as an art gallery problem, which is NP-hard and no finite algorithm, even exponential, is known for its solution. Algorithms able to closely approximate the optimal solution and computationally feasible in the worst case are unlikely to exist. In this paper we propose a new sensor locating incremental algorithm. The technique converges toward the optimal solution. It locally refines a starting approximation provided by an integer covering algorithm, where each edge is observed entirely by at least one sensor.

First, two improvements to the state-of-the-art region growing algorithm are presented to make it faster without losing precision for unstructured environments. One is to add the seed selection procedure based on local shape information to avoid blind growth. The other is to simplify the plane fitting mean square error computation complex. Second, a novel algorithm called grid-based region growing is presented for structured environments. The point cloud is divided into small patches based on neighborhood information when it is viewed as a range image. The small patch is called grid. Then the grids are classified into different categories according to their local appearance, including sparse, planar, spherical and linear. Finally, the planar grids are clustered into big patches by region growing. The plane parameters are incrementally computed whenever a new grid is added. The resulting planes can be used for 3D plane simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Experimental results show promising plane detecting speed for both structured and unstructured environments.",

	abstract = "The generation of accurate, watertight, three-dimensional models of environments are often crucial for the purposes of scientific study and infrastructure management. Most commonly, such models are acquired by using range sensors producing point clouds, and further processing steps are required for the construction of a surface model. We used a mobile lidar to map several kilometers of a natural cave system in order to obtain 3D volumetric models for use in scientific research studying the local palaeo-climatic record. For unstructured and GPS-denied environments, such as cave systems, the process of acquiring a complete map is difficult and further complicated by limited mobility within the cave. During the mapping process, many unwanted measurements occur due to occlusions from moving objects such as other people present in the cave. Most common point cloud surface reconstruction techniques are not designed to deal these occlusions; i.e., they require manual cleanup of the data set or are not capable of generating watertight surfaces. The large scale of the environments introduces the additional challenge of dealing with memory limitations. We propose a new volume-based approach to reconstruct a watertight surface from range measurements of enclosed environments without limitation on the scale of the collected data. Our approach carves all unoccupied voxels from the sensor to a triangulated and rasterized surface between successive scans, which is intended to fill in the missing data between the scan rays. The surface is then constructed from the isosurface between unoccupied and unknown cells. By decomposing the space, we are able to handle large-scale data without exceeding the memory limitation of a standard PC, at the cost of some additional computation time. The algorithm has been evaluated across several datasets within a variety of environments and observed to build more complete volumetric models than a simple space carving approach. We have mapped severa- kilometers of cave networks and, with the described method, produced watertight reconstructions suitable for further scientific analysis.",

We fuse all of the depth data streamed from a Kinect sensor into a single global implicit surface model of the observed scene in real-time. The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.",

	abstract = "We describe the design of high-performance parallel radix sort and merge sort routines for manycore GPUs, taking advantage of the full programmability offered by CUDA. Our radix sort is the fastest GPU sort and our merge sort is the fastest comparison-based sort reported in the literature. Our radix sort is up to 4 times faster than the graphics-based GPUSort and greater than 2 times faster than other CUDA-based radix sorts. It is also 23\% faster, on average, than even a very carefully optimized multicore CPU sorting routine. To achieve this performance, we carefully design our algorithms to expose substantial fine-grained parallelism and decompose the computation into independent tasks that perform minimal global communication. We exploit the high-speed onchip shared memory provided by NVIDIA's GPU architecture and efficient data-parallel primitives, particularly parallel scan. While targeted at GPUs, these algorithms should also be well-suited for other manycore processors.",
